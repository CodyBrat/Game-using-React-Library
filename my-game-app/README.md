Memory Card Game

Hey there! This is a super simple memory card game I built while learning React. It's nothing fancy, but it works!

What's this game about?

It's a classic memory matching game where you:
Flip cards to see what emoji is hiding underneath
Try to find all the matching pairs
Win the game when all pairs are found
Challenge yourself to finish in fewer moves

How to play?

1. Just click on any card to flip it
2. Click another card to try to find a match
3. If they match, awesome! They'll turn green and stay flipped
4. If they don't match, no worries - they'll flip back down
5. Keep going until you find all the matches
6. Try to beat your own score by using fewer moves



Making this game taught me some React concepts:

useState: How to create and update data (like keeping track of flipped cards)
useEffect: How to run code when something changes (like checking if game is over)
Conditional rendering: Showing different things based on game state
Event handling: Making stuff happen when cards are clicked
CSS transitions & animations: Making cards flip and adding cool effects



How to run the game?
Just run these commands:

cd my-game-app
npm install
npm run dev

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

This was my first simple React game. Hope you enjoy it! ðŸ˜Š
